Subject: Tip of the Day - How to Make a Protein

Hello all,
 
I've received some content questions lately about the segments of DNA and RNA required to make a protein.  I thought everyone would benefit from the answer, so I'm sending this to all of you.
 
There are several regions of DNA that are required to make a protein at the end of the day.  They are (in order):
1. Promoter to tell RNA Pol where to start transcription (you should also know some common promoter elements for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes; see bio chapter 2)
2. Transcription start site, where RNA Pol starts synthesizing RNA
3. Translation regulatory regions, that tell the ribosome where to dock; these are commonly called the 5'UTR or 5' untranslated region, and include regulatory sequences like the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (in prokaryotes) and the Kozak sequence (in eukaryotes)
4. Start codon, where the ribosome starts protein synthesis (AUG)
5. The gene coding region, which can include exons which are kept during splicing, and introns which are removed during splicing
6. A stop codon (UAG, UGA, UAA)
7. The 3' UTR or untranslated region, which is extra transcript past the stop codon
8. Transcription termination sequence, telling RNA Pol that is it done now (this can be a poly-A sequence in eukaryotes)
 
If this seems a little confusing to you, I recommend that you draw it all out and play with transcription and translation a little.  Let me know if you need any help with this.
 
Cheers,
Claire
