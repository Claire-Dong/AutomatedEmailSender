Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Book Time Off!

Hi there,
 
Today's tip of the day is specifically for those of you who are working full or part time jobs, or are full time students while you are studying for the MCAT.  It is really important that you book some serious time off before the MCAT.  If you are a student, you'll need to figure out how to put your studies temporarily on the back-burner so you can focus on MCAT studying.
 
In the days leading up to the test (the last week and a half or two weeks), you should be doing a full length test every other day.  You should aim to start at 9am (just like the real test) and should time yourself accurately, including breaks.  The evenings and days when you're not doing a full length test should be spent going over the content you got wrong on the test, and last minute studying and memorizing.
 
Based on this ideal plan, you can see why it is so important that you get as much time off work/school as possible. 
 
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks,
Claire
