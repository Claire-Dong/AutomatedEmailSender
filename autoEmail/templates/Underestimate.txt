Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Underestimating biology

Hello everyone,
 
I wanted to send out a somewhat cautionary tip of the day.  Most of you are likely most comfortable with the biology content that is going to be on the MCAT (i.e. you feel you know the biology better than say physics or Ochem and that you're less worried about biology than the other science topics).
 
That is great and makes me very happy.
 
But, I have to caution you.  The biology content that you'll see on the MCAT is typically a notch higher in difficulty.  For example, there are some biology concepts that crop up on the MCAT again and again that are usually taught at the third year University level.  Most of the chemistry is from typical first or second year classes and most of the physics is from a first year University level.  Also, there is A LOT of biology content you need to know for the test and this section falls at the end of your test day when you are tired and stressed and restless and want to go home.
 
My general take home message for you today is that you shouldn't underestimate the power of MCAT biology.  Even though you're a little more comfortable with this content, you need to still put in fair study time.  Come to class, do the (very long and sometimes laborious) pre-readings, diligently work through your homework and dedicate yourself to learning MCAT biology.  I have seen some students gets burned in the past because they were relying too much on their comfort level in the biological sciences section.  There tend to be some tricky biology passages (especially experimental passages; these tend to be the ones that require you to merge what you know AND all the new stuff they introduce that you've never seen before - a tough task).  The only way you can make sure you'll be able to get through these on test day is to practice now and study now - as much as possible.
 
Let me know if you need clarification or if you have any questions,
Claire
