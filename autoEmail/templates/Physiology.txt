Subject: Physiology Starts Next Class!

Hello all!

Just a quick email to remind you that in the next class (Bio7) we are starting human physiology content. If you havenâ€™t taken a human physiology course, you will find these pre-readings take a long time. Be sure to siphon off some extra study time to account for this.
 
Also, just one more reminder that I will not be teaching any human anatomy. We will be focusing on the much more challenging human physiology in class. Please make sure you learn the basic anatomy as you do your pre-readings for the next five classes.

Cheers,
Claire
