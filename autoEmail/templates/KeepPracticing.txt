Subject: Keep Up with Practice Tests!

Hello there,
 
Many of you have not been doing the practice tests on the suggested schedule.  I just wanted to send out a reminder that the best way to improve and the way to get the most out of this course is to stick to the schedule.  Do the pre-readings, come to class, do your homework and write the practice test on the suggested day.  This is by far the best way to see score improvements. Our Research and Development (R&D) department spends all their time making sure the courses are scheduled in the best possible way.  Trust them.  :)
 
In summary: Overall, your best diagnostic plan is to do a test every 2 weeks while you're studying, and then do a test every other day in the 2 weeks before your test date.
 
Good luck keeping up and I hope you're all doing well,
Claire
