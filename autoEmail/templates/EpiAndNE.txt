Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Epi and NE

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you a line and remind you that epinephrine is an amino acid hormone.  Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system and functions at the post-ganglionic synapse.  They are similar in that both play roles in the sympathetic stress response (i.e. increased blood glucose, etc).
 
I hope studying is going well,
Claire
