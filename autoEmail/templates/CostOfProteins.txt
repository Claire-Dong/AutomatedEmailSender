Subject: Tip of the Day - Cost of Proteins

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you an email and remind you that it costs 4n high energy bonds to make a protein (via translation), where n is the number of amino acids in the peptide chain.
 
Initiation costs 3 high energy bonds:
- 2 high energy bonds to link Met to its tRNA via an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase
- 1 high energy bond to bring Met-tRNA into the P site of the ribosome
 
Elongation costs 4 high energy bonds per amino acid:
- 2 high energy bonds to link each amino acid to its tRNA via the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase family of enzymes
- 1 high energy bond to bring the amino acid into the ribosome
- 1 high energy bond to move the ribosome over by one codon or three nucleotides
 
Termination costs one high energy bond.
 
See Bio3 for more information and let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,
Claire
