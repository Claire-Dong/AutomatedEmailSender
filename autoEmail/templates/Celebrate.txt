Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Celebration Plan!

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you a line to recommend that you all come up with a great way to celebrate your success on MCAT day.  Perhaps you could go out for dinner, or get together with friends.  Whatever you do, be sure to get out there and enjoy being done.  You've prepared well for this exam!
 
Cheers,
Claire
