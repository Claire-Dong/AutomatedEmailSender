Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Preparation and Clothing

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to remind you that you should go into the MCAT prepared for anything.  Bring a sweater (some test centers are chilly), some Tylenol/Advil (in case you get a headache half way through), food, drink, ID, etc.  Pack all this up the night before, NOT the day of the test.  If you need to buy anything, do it days before the test, not the night before.  Wear comfy clothes and shoes that you can easily sit in for an entire day.  Make sure you've done laundry, so you have clean clothes to wear.
 
Also, be sure to do a test center practice run before your test date. Find the parking, figure out where you're going, find the bathrooms, etc.  Most centers will even let you pop in for a look of the place.
 
Be sure you have a Plan B and a Plan C for getting to your test center.  What happens if the busses are down? If there is construction? If your car won't start? Do you have some Taxi companies programmed into your phone just in case?
 
Cheers,
Claire
