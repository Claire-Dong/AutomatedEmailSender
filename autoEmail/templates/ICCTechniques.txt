Subject: Tip of the Day - ICC Techniques

Hello all!
 
I just wanted to remind you that all the techniques and tips we go over in class when we're working an ICC are things you should be adopting and using as you do homework, and ultimately when you take the MCAT.  The techniques we use are tried, tested and true and will help you save time, get questions correct and earn more points. Things may seem to take a lot of time right now, but the more you use them, the faster you'll get and the more natural strategies will feel.
 
A lot of things on the board during an ICC should also be on your passage (i.e. highlighted words and things on scratch paper). By dissecting and decoding the passage, and writing things down on your scratch paper, material will feel friendlier and more familiar.  By using techniques to narrow down answer options (using the strike out tool and POE), you're increasing your odds of finding the right answer, and more importantly, you're making sure that the trick answers aren't snagging you.
 
Some quick tips:
- highlight key words to help to identify what each paragraph in the passage is about; don't dwell on detail, but look for big picture topics and themes
- don't get bogged down in experiments and figures (skip them or skim them)
- watch for vague or cryptic parts of the passage: can you fill in the holes or figure out what’s going on?
- don’t get freaked out by new information; focus on what you know and what’s familiar
- use your scratch paper to summarize the bottom line of each paragraph, do math, work with figures (as needed) or jot down key ideas
- watch for free-standing questions and tackle them first, especially if you're not sure of passage content
- answer questions on your terms: find questions you’re confident in and do them first, then gradually slow down as you work harder questions
- start to keep track of HOW you can use the info in the passage to answer questions
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.  In the mean time, work on adopting techniques from class into your everyday study habits.  You won't regret it!
 
Cheers,
Claire
