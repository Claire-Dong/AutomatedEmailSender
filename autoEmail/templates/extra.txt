Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Extracurriculars

Hi all,

I recently had a student inquire about tips on what extracurriculars to pursue and I thought this might be useful to all of you as well!

Keep in mind these are my personal opinions and everyone has a different route to medicine:

- Research. Look into Sick Kids (for Canadian folks), any profs you might know, your undergrad programs, or nearby hospitals. Get a poster or manuscript published, go to a research conference. Think about doing this during your school year or 3rd/4th year summer. Learn what critical inquiry is, how self-directed learning works, and the importance of an interdisciplinary team. 

- Activities that expose you to diverse populations. Don't just go for the cookie cutter "hospital volunteering", think about working at an immigration centre, suicide helpline, rehabilitation centre, etc. Even McDonald's, a receptionist job, or retail at a busy city centre! Think customer service for a wide range of different people. You'll learn lots about how to deal with people with backgrounds that are drastically different from yours. You'll also learn how to approach and talk to people in different situations, especially when they're angry at you. 

- Activities that require collaboration or group work. This will show off your communication and teamwork skills. Examples include working at McDonalds, a summer camp, or food bank. Other group work examples could come from your research team, undergrad group work, or any clubs you're involved in. Did you have conflict with your group members? Did one of them dislike you for no apparent reason? What did you do when your idea clashed with someone else's? How do you move forward in these situations?

- Think about what you're passionate about. If you commit to something you don't care about (Ex. food bank volunteering), you're less likely to continue it or have interesting stories for your applications. For example, I'm super interested in makeup and I love to write code! So I started a makeup club and joined a coding startup as a front-end developer writing javascript, python, and C. If you pursue your interests, it will show off your personal characteristics and ensure it's something you'll do in the long-term. Furthermore, it will actually add value to your life so you don't feel like a pre-med who's dead inside :(

- Reflect on what your weaknesses are. Do you fear public speaking? Teach at a science summer camp. Cringe at the thought of talking to strangers? Work at a call centre. Not sure how to interact with people with disabilities? Volunteer at a long-term care home. 

- Lastly, no matter what extracurricular you pursue, it is what you LEARN from it, not what your title was. This is why I tell students to pursue your passion! Regardless of the activity, you WILL learn group work, communication, and empathy. Your applications and secondaries are all about framing. Think of stories/ instances where you messed up big time, where you had a huge fight, or came to a great realization about how you're not perfect. These humbling and at times embarrassing stories tell someone A LOT about who you are as a person and it SHOWS personal growth a lot more than some prestigious title ever will. 

At the end of the day, these are my experiences through my pre-med journey. Take from it what you will and discover your own path to self-growth and medicine!

Best,
Claire
