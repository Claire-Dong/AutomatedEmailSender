Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Annoyances

Hello there!
 
On the day of the MCAT, you're going to be writing this incredibly important test in a room full of many other bodies.  That means you're going to be putting up with a lot of your stressed out peers for many hours.  Fellow test-takers can have many annoying habits.  Here are a few things you might have to put up with:
- tapping feet or tapping pencils
- mumbling or quiet talking
- loud typers
- overpowering smells (either perfume or bad body smells)
- sniffling (lots of people have allergies or might have a cold)
- constant coughing
- finger or knuckle cracking
- major wiggling around
- major stress attacks (this will be other people - not you!)
- constant heavy sighing (especially if someone is over-tired)
- loud gum chewers or poppers
- squeaky pencils
- grumbly stomach
 
Do your best to break yourself of any bad habits that you might have (and many times not even be aware of), and make a conscious effort to be nice to your fellow test takers by not doing any of these annoying things.  With that in mind though, some things are unavoidable and some people just aren't nice enough to consider those around them.  You could have any one of those annoying habits sitting right beside you, so it is important that you work on your concentration to make sure nothing gets in the way of your MCAT success.  Look back at some Tip of the Days from the past weeks for concentration strategies.


Happy studying and thanks,
