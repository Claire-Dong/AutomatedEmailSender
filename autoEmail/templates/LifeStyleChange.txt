Subject: Tip of the Day – Lifestyle Changes

Hello there,
 
A slightly odd and hopefully humorous tip of the day for you today...  Although I'm being completely serious at the same time...
 
Every year in my class, there is a student who decides that the weeks right before the MCAT are the best time for them to make a major lifestyle change.
 
This is not a good plan.
 
Please don't plan on moving in the weeks before the MCAT.
If you need to break up with your partner or fiancé, please do this now and not in the weeks right before the MCAT.
If you need to quit smoking, either do it immediately or wait until after the test.  I don't want any of you having nicotine cravings in the middle of CARS.
If you need to crash diet for a friend's wedding or some other event, change your eating habits now (and healthily) and not in the weeks leading up to the MCAT.  I don't want any of you being hungry during the test.
 
Do you see what I mean?
Plan to be nice to yourself in the weeks right before the MCAT.
 
Any avoidable life altering decisions or events should be done now or should wait until after you're written the test.
 
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks,
Claire
