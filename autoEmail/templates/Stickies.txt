Subject: Tip of the Day - Stickies

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you a quick email to suggest a quick memorization strategy.  Put tiny, bite sized pieces of information on post-it notes and stick them around your life.  For example:
 
- put the key characteristics of E2 reactions on a sticky and put it around your TV screen
- throw the steroid hormones on a sticky and fasten it to your bathroom mirror
- put the strong acids on a sticky and put it over your alarm clock so you need to stare at it every morning
- put your favourite but most forgettable carboxylic acid reaction on a sticky and put it beside your bed
- write out the 5 Hardy-Weinberg assumptions and put the sticky on your computer monitor
 
See what I mean?  Fill your life with tiny, little notes, full of MCAT-relevant information.  Cater to your needs and put info or equations that you commonly get mixed up on the notes.  Then get creative about where you're putting them.
 
Happy stickying,
Claire
 
PS. You could even colour code the stickies by subject; the possibilities are endless, really...
