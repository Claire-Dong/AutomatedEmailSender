Subject: Important Proteins from Bio 1-5

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you a quick email and remind you that you don't need to memorize the names of the enzymes involved in glycolysis, Kreb's or ETC/OP, except the few key regulators were focused on in Bio1.
 
There are lots of other enzymes and proteins that you DO need to know some key details on for the MCAT.  For more information, refer back to your class notes  and check out this summary list.  For each of the proteins below, you should have a sense of what it does and why it is important:
