Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Blood Flow and Surface Area

Hello there,

I just wanted to send you a quick email and remind you about some key characteristics of blood vessels and blood flow.  Here is the deal:
 
ARTERIES AND VEINS
These vessels have a large cross sectional area (i.e. a relatively big diameter).  Using the physics relationships we talked about in class, this means that the blood will have relatively little resistance to flow.  Low resistance means high blood flow (i.e. the blood is really moving through arteries and veins).  Now, cross sectional area is very different from surface area. Arteries and veins have a relatively small surface area; if you took all your arteries and spread them out flat, they wouldn't cover that much space.
 
CAPILLARIES
Capillaries have a tiny diameter, or cross sectional area.  This means lots of resistance, and as a consequence, slow blood flow (this snail's pace blood flow allows time for exchange across the capillary walls).  However, if you took all the capillaries out of your body and spread them out flat, they would cover an enormous area; capillaries have a huge surface area and a tiny cross sectional area.
 
Please let me know if you need any clarification and I hope studying is going well,
Claire
