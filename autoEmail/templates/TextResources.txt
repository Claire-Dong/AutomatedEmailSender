Subject: Tip of the Day - Text Resources

Hello!
 
I wanted to take a few minutes you remind you all of some really useful resources in your Review books:
 
GLOSSARY
A glossary can be found at the end of each of your science review books and contains a really thorough list of key terms, with definitions and where they're found in the review book. Check these out – they’re really useful and by the end of the course, you should be solid on all those key terms.
 
EQUATION SHEETS
There are formula summary sheets at the back of the Gchem and physics books, which contain equations you must memorize for the MCAT.  
 
REACTION LIST
There is a summary list of Ochem reactions at the back of the Ochem review book. As a general rule, if a reaction or mechanism is in the Ochem Review text, you should be familiar with it for the MCAT.
 
MCAT MATH
You need to be able to do mental math on test day.  See the Math chapters at the back of the physics review book for more information.
 
LAB TECHNIQUES
You need to be familiar with a wide variety of biology lab techniques for the MCAT.  Please check out biology Appendix I for more information.  I will not be teaching this content in class, so please review it on your own.  Also note that you need to know many Ochem lab techniques as well, but these are taught in Ochem class 2 and covered in Ochem chapter 5.
 
PEDIGREE ANALYSIS
This genetics topic is not technically on the MCAT syllabus, but is sometimes on the test. The appendix on this at the back of your Bio review book lays out some principles for how to tackle pedigree problems.
 
STATISTICS
You also need to be familiar with some basic biostatistics.  Please check out the Statistics & Research Methods Appendix in the Physics and Math review book for more information. 
 
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks,
Claire
