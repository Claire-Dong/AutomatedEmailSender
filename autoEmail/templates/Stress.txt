Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Stress

Hi there,
 
How do you deal with stress?
What happens do you when you get stressed?
 
You need to come up with a de-stress plan over the next few weeks so that just in case you start to get a bit nervous during the exam, you will know what needs to be done to calm down and get back on track.  Here are some suggestions:
- deep breathing
- close your eyes for 3 seconds
- clench and unclench your hands
- mini neck massage
- shrug your shoulders
- mini-pep talk in your head
- stretch your head side to side
- put down your pencil for 3 seconds and look away from the computer screen
- visualize your name with an MD after it
 
Whatever will help, find it now.  Come up with a de-stress plan, just in case.
Listen to your body and monitor yourself.
 
Good luck studying,
Claire
