Subject: Tip of the Day - PP Hormones

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you a line and remind you that the two Posterior Pituitary hormones are oxytocin (which functions in 'P'regnancy) and ADH (which controls 'P'ee).  If this is a surprise to you, get those hormones memorized asap!
 
Also, it is important to remember that these hormones are not made in the posterior pituitary, just secreted from the posterior pituitary.  They are synthesized in the hypothalamus.
 
I hope studying is going well,
Claire
