Subject: Going down?!

Hi there,
 
Many people find that their scores actually go down on the second practice test.  This is a common trend and nothing to be worried about.  The reasoning is this: By the second test, you're in the MCAT head space, but only just.  You're thinking about content, you're focusing on strategies, you're remembering formulas and writing them out, you're thinking about pacing...  While all of this is important, it also takes a long of time at first.  While you're focusing and concentrating on all of these things, it takes away from your cognitive successes.
 
If you went down on the second test, never fear.
You will rebound right back up by the third one and things can only go up from there.
Eventually, your content recall will happen faster.  Pacing will turn second nature with enough practice.  You will learn to block annoying environmental sounds (more tips on techniques you can use for this will be coming in future tips of the day).  Formulas will flow from your pencil.  The strategies will become a common part of your test taking skills, instead of something you need to focus on and think about.  All of this will happen first and foremost with practice, and also with time.
 
Keep your positive attitude going and keep working hard.  Even if you feel downhearted, I know you can all do this.  I'm seeing subtle and obvious improvements in class everyday. I am cheering for you and am here to support you.  Let me know if you need anything from me.

Have a super day and thanks,
Claire
