Subject: Tip of the day - Ideal Study Plan

Hello folks,
 
I have been getting a few questions on how to study best for this course and I thought I would share this with everyone. Here is an example of a best case scenario and some of my recommendations:

· Early on in the course, focus on pre-readings and try to get a little ahead.  Don't skim read, but read for comprehension. Instead of spending your time taking notes, use a highlighter to engage active reading and make little sticky notes on the sides of your page. Nothing too extensive. This way, your notes will mostly come from class and class time will give you a second review of all the material after reading everything once. Watch for areas that you find confusing and flag them, so you can re-read this content and/or return to it after it has been covered in class.

· Come to class.  Since you have already read through the chapter that is going to be covered, you should do a review before class to refresh on the content and to remind yourself which topics you struggled with.

· Review your class notes after class to make sure you understood what we were talking about. You may want to merge your class notes with your pre-reading study notes to general some sort of mega-awesome version of notes. Some students find this really helps and others find it is not a good use of their study time.

· Complete your homework. It is ok to save some passages (especially the difficult ones) for later in the course. In the beginning of the course, it is understandable to be more involved with readings than FSQs or PBQs. But I'd like you to develop a habit of practicing testing strategy because it is just as important as bio content! You should be thoroughly reviewing and going through the solution for every question you do. This is a great diagnostic tool to identify your weaknesses. Make sure you understand the solution as well as the question.  Pay special attention on questions where you got it down to two answer options, and watch for strategy and technique ideas in the solutions (i.e. this was a 2-by-2 question, this answer option was especially tempting because..., a cool way to answer this question is to..., etc.)

· Do practice tests on the course schedule.  A good general rule is to take a practice test every 2 weeks.

· Near the end of the course, you will want to spend more time reviewing content, redoing passages and working on more practice tests. The maximum schedule for practice tests is one test every other day in the last two weeks of your course.

 
Sticking to this study plan takes a lot of time and a lot of dedication. The average student finds they need about 300 hours of study time total, so about 100 hours per month. If you have not been in school for a while, have not taken science classes in a while, or have never taken a course in a certain subject, you will need to set aside even more study time, since pre-readings will take much longer and will need to be done more than once. Don’t be afraid to re-visit pre-readings, passages and questions that you find tricky.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions!
Best wishes,
Claire
