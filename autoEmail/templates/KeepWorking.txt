Subject: Keep Working Hard!

Hello all,
 
I wanted to send you a quick email to remind you to keep chugging away at MCAT studying with a vengeance.  I know you're busy with lots of different things right now, but you need to find and dedicate time to MCAT studying.  Remember that people who score well on the test generally put in a MINIMUM of 300 hours of study time.  How much have you put in?
 
When you come to class, the content that is taught should be 100% review, especially at this stage of the game.  You should be able to answer the questions we're asking.  You should be following what we're saying.  If this is not the case, you are not spending enough time on pre-readings.  Before you come to class, you should have been through the pre-readings in detail and should have taken study notes too.
 
Also, you need to start working ahead in content.  In an ideal world, you will have done a pass through ALL the content by 6-8 weeks before your MCAT test date.  I've said this before but want to reiterate.  From 6-2 weeks before the test, you should be doing as much practice as you can (that is why the Science Workbook is so gigantic).  Also, you should be getting your memorization under control.  Do you have all the formulas memorized?  Do you have the human hormones memorized?  You should.  If you don't, get going as soon as possible.
 
I'm not trying to stress you out, but am trying to really emphasize that this test requires some serious study time.  Take advantage of weekends and days off. Use the short breaks between class.  Read during lunch.  Get up earlier in the mornings.  Find time for MCAT studying so you'll start to see score improvements asap and not at the last minute, or even worse...  not at all.
 
Let me know if you have any questions,
Claire
