Subject: Guessing and the Letter of the Day

Hi there,
 
I just wanted to drop you a line and remind you that when you're filling in answers for passages you haven't done (i.e. the killer in each section, especially CARS), be consistent and always guess with the same letter; we call this "the letter of the day".  Statistically, this is the best way to increase the chances of picking right answers.  No one letter is better than the rest, so just pick your favourite and click away.
 
Cheers,
Claire
