Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Practice as you Walk

Hi there,
 
For those of you who are tight on time, try this quick memorization and study strategy.  While you are doing something else (see below for examples), take 5 minutes and brainstorm to yourself a certain MCAT concept.  For example:
- picture a titration curve in your head and try to label it, as you walk from home to class
- recite which organs are derived from the mesoderm in your head, while you're waiting for your coffee to be made
- walk through the steps of depolarization and reploarization of neurons, while you go for a run or do a rep of bicep curls
- try to remember what kinases, phosphatases and phosphorylases do, while you style or blow-dry your hair
- brainstorm as many VSEPR shapes as you can, while you sit on the bus
- compare kinetic and potential energy, while waiting in line at the grocery store
 
If you force yourself to think MCAT at random times, you can actually cram in a lot more study time that you ever thought possible.
 
Let me know if you need clarification and good luck studying,
Claire
