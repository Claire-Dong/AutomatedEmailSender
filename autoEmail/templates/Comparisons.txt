Subject: Tip of the Day – The MCAT Loves Comparisons

Greetings everyone!
 
The MCAT loves comparison questions, because they test more than one topic and critical thinking abilities all at the same time. Here are some comparisons that the MCAT could ask about.  This is not an exhaustive list, but is a good study start spot:
 
• Aerobic respiration vs. anaerobic respiration
• Oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes vs. prokaryotes
• Glycolysis vs. gluconeogenesis
• Anabolism vs. catabolism of biomolecules (such as lipids, carbohydrates, proteins)
• RNA vs. DNA – structure and function
• Gyrase vs. topoisomerase
• Different types of RNA
• DNA replication vs. transcription vs. reverse transcriptase in viruses
• Eukaryote vs. prokaryote cell biology
• Viruses vs. bacteria vs. fungi
• Lytic vs. lysogenic vs. productive viral reproduction
• Mitosis vs. binary fission
• Conjugation vs. transformation vs. transduction vs. transfection
• Active vs. passive transport
• X-linked vs. autosomal vs. Y-linked vs. mitochondrial inheritance
• Mitosis vs. meiosis vs. spermatogenesis vs. oogenesis
• Steroid vs. peptide hormones
• Endocrine vs. nervous system, and neurotransmitters vs. hormones
• Somatic vs. autonomic nervous system
• Sympathetic vs. parasympathetic nervous system
• Arterioles/arteries vs. venuoles/veins
• Cardiac vs. smooth vs. skeletal muscles
• Action potential graphs: nervous system vs. skeletal muscle vs. cardiac muscle vs. SA node
• T cells vs. B cells (cell mediated vs. humoral immunity)
• MHCI vs. MHCII
• Antibodies vs. the T-cell receptor
• Endocrine vs. exocrine
• Inspiration vs. expiration
• Conduction zone of the respiratory system vs. respiratory zone
• Follicular development vs. oocyte development
• Ovarian cycle vs. uterine cycle
 
Be on the look out for these comparisons and use this list to guide you in your studying as the MCAT gets closer. Let me know if you have any questions.
