Subject: Tip of the Day – Watch the Wording

Hello all,

Today's tip is a caution about genetics questions.  Check out these three question stems:
What is the probability of their son having…?
What is the probability of them having a son who…?
What is the probability of their child having…?

These 3 questions can all look the same at the end of a long test day.  However, they are actually asking you very different things.  In the first one, you know the child is male and do not need to include a probability calculation for this. In the second, you need to include a p = 0.5 for the chances of the child being a male. In the third one, sex of the child doesn't matter.

How the MCAT asks the question will affect how you answer it. Make sure you pay close attention to details in genetics questions, so you don't fall for any tricks.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Best,
Claire
