Subject: Tip of the Day - Timing

Hi there,
 
Many students find time limitations one of the most stressful parts about writing the MCAT.  If this is the case, you'll want to start keeping an eye on the clock as you're doing practice questions and passages.  For right now, you'll find that homework will take a long time, as you get used to working with passages and you're practicing and using all the techniques we use and teach in class.
 
Soon though, you'll want to start keeping track of how long passages are taking you to complete.  A good general rule to start is to take the number of questions and multiply this by 120 seconds (or 2 minutes). In this time, you should be able read, highlight and map the passage, and answer all the questions.  Over the next few months, this factor should gradually decrease.  If you can do the whole passage using the x120 rule (and get the questions correct), decrease it to x115, then x110, then x105, then x100.  By slowly giving yourself less time, you'll get faster at working passages and answering questions.  The key is to not decrease your time factor until you're getting the questions right; if you invest the time into reading and mapping the passage, you should be getting all the questions correct.
 
Finally, you should be spending about 2 minutes reading and mapping the passage.  If you're taking longer than this, you might be wasting valuable time.
 
Let me know if you need clarification or if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,
Claire
