Subject: Tip of the Day – Strike-Out Tool

Hi there!

I just wanted to chat to you a little about the strike out tool on the MCAT.

This tool lets you cross off answer options that you know are incorrect. This is a really useful tool for the MCAT and helps you do POE (process of elimination).

For the most part, you should be going through the 4 answer options in a two pass approach. Go through them and strike out any that you know for sure are incorrect. This is your "first pass" through the answer options. You might be able to strike out one, two or three.  If you strike out all four, you're going to have to go back to the beginning of the question and try again.  

During your second pass, you have to focus on the answer options that are left. If there is only one left, you're in good shape. If you have two or three answer options left, you're going to have to spend more time with them to figure out how they're different and which one is the best answer.  The benefit of this strategy is that by striking out some answer options on your first pass, you're statistically increasing your chances of picking the correct answer. This also helps you focus on why answer choices are wrong, instead of looking for the right answer.

Also, keep in mind that strike outs are retained if you flip from question to question.  If you mark a question and come back to it later, your strike-outs will still be there. You can also use the strike out tool on answer options that are figures; the figure will go light grey to show you’ve eliminated it. The A/B/C/D letter beside the grey image will have a line through it.

Please let me know if you have any questions,
Claire
