Subject: Tip of the Day - Study Location

Hello all,
 
Now is the time to push your study comfort level.  You need to study all over the place and force yourself to focus no matter what.  Brainstorm a list of random places (a few suggestions are Starbucks, your favourite library, a park, your living room, your bedroom, the mall or another atrium, Second Cup, etc), go there and study for an hour or two.  Make sure you actually force yourself to work and you'll be surprised how good you get at studying anywhere.  The MCAT is not going to be quiet and is not going to be a perfect atmosphere.  Get used to distractions now instead of the day of the test; remember that those noise-reducing earphones that the AAMC provides are fairly useful but get uncomfortable by the end of a long test day.
 
Let me know if you'd like more suggestions or clarification and good lucking studying hard,
Claire
