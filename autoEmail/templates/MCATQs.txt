Subject: General MCAT Advice...

Hi all,

Here are some general questions I've answered regarding the MCAT from previous students accumulated through the years. Hopefully they can be of value!:


1. For the MCAT, what is your advice when it comes to the readings, class, and videos? 

Before class: 
Do the prereadings. Highlight instead of making detailed notes to speed that up. If the information gets too dense, write on little sticky notes and stick that to the pages. This drastically speeds up the pre-readings time. Furthermore, it prevents you from getting bogged down in details because the MCAT doesn't care about details/regurgitation! It cares about critical thinking. Don't watch the videos as they are meant to be watched if you MISS class. Primer questions and diagnostic tests are also not as essential. Do them if you have time or need the extra practice.

During class: 
Come for a review of the pre-readings. Answer questions to reinforce your thinking and connect ideas. Doing pre-readings before class also allows you to ask any questions to your teachers so you get the best bang for your buck!

After class: 
Do the practice passages. 
Order of importance goes: online passages > science work book or CARS work book passages > primer questions. 
Do at least 5-10 practice passages a day. Towards the end of your studying months, do an ADDITIONAL 4 CARS passages day. (Canadian schools happen to care about CARS A LOT, might be different for America). Time them appropriately and do them EVERY SINGLE DAY no matter what day it is. Give yourself 90 minutes for 10 passages. This helps to improve time management. After doing the passages, use them to diagnose your weakness. Did you get a question wrong because you didn't know the content? (go back to your readings), or because you didn't understand the experiment (read the appendices for experimental techniques), or was it a testing strategy problem? (do more practice!) 

--------------------------------------------------------------

2. I find myself running out of time on passages, how can I improve my time management?

First do a passage as well as you can and time how long it takes. Doesn't matter if it took you 11 minutes, 12 minutes, or 13 minutes as long as you do the best you can. If it took you, for example, 12 minutes, use that as a basis to time all your passages. The following week, decrease that 12 minutes by 30 seconds. The week after that, decrease by another 30 seconds. Keep doing this week-by-week until you reach that coveted 9 minutes per passage.

By doing this, you'll find week-by-week that maybe you didn't need to spend as long looking at graphs, or maybe you highlighted too much, or spent too long deciding between answer choices. This will maximize your scores while still keeping your time low. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

3. I'm lacking motivation to study :(

If you find yourself lacking motivation, it's ultimately up to you to find the cause and fix it. Here's some things I can recommend though!

- Do a practice test (TPR or AAMC). Maybe seeing your current score will motivate you to study harder.
- Hit the gym! I find the physical activity helps to focus my brain and pushes me to follow a strict studying schedule. 
- Intersperse studying with some physical activity perhaps.
- Study together with some friends. Maybe this can help you stay focused for a longer period of time if they're also hardcore about the MCAT.
- Maybe even get your friends or family to quiz you.
- Try studying in a different environment (I recommend your campus library). You have no other stimulus and you're forced to study. 
- Maybe set goals. Allow yourself to go shopping/ hang out with friends if you finish your readings or homework passages.

Ultimately figure out why you want to write the MCAT and how much it means to you. I've had tons of friends who spent a summer studying and writing the MCAT to realize they don't want to do more schooling or even be a doctor. It took one gruelling summer for them to realize that. However, it opened up other options for them; optometry, pharmacy, business, entrepreneurship ... etc...

--------------------------------------------------------------

4. How soon after the course should I take the MCAT?

There's generally two takes to this.

Short Term Study Plan:
The typical expectation is that you have 2 weeks after the course to run through additional TPR practice questions, TPR practice tests, AAMC tests, and AAMC question packs. Some students prefer to take the MCAT early and give themselves time in case they want to do a re-write. This is especially the case if they want to apply this current cycle. This might also be the case if you have a vacation booked.

Long Term Study Plan:
With that being said, many students find it helpful to take another month or two after the course to review the content themselves for a better understanding in addition to extra practice. It's a lot of material and sometimes sitting in lecture is not enough! You may want to make notes yourself, memorize additional information, and have the time to space out your practice tests. (However, keep in mind conditions for the 510 guarantee! You must take practice tests according to the syllabus for this.) Some students also supplement with resources from other test companies and like having the additional time to do so. The idea here is to be as prepared as possible so you don't have to rewrite. 

Overall, gauge how well you can keep up with the course. Furthermore, take a practice test first and see how you feel: If you have no problems doing the prereadings, coming to class, doing the practice homework, AND doing practice tests on the weekend, then give yourself 2 weeks after the course to write the MCAT. If this is too much to keep up with and you are not happy with your practice test score, then by all means push it back. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

5. My TPR practice test scores are not so great, what do I do?

Keep in mind the TPR practice tests are designed to be more difficult than the AAMC ones! And that's a good thing! Write a scored AAMC test and see how well you do on those, they are the most accurate predictors of your score.

--------------------------------------------------------------

6. What do med schools think about an applicant retaking the MCAT?

Look into the schools you are applying to:

Do they take a holistic view of your MCAT scores? 
- In that case, doing worse on your 2nd or 3rd try will look pretty bad. They want to see a continuous improvement on your re-tries.

Do they look at your highest MCAT score? 
- Then perfect, nothing to worry about. 

Or do they look at your most recent MCAT score? 
-In the case, make sure you will do better on your 3rd try than your 2nd, or else there is really no point in a retake. 


Hope that helps,
