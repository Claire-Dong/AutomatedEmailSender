Subject: Tip of the Day - Food and the MCAT

Hi all,
 
You need to have a good breakfast on the day of the test.  I recommend one high in protein (eggs perhaps?) and be sure to eat something on ALL breaks.  Don't let a grumbling stomach lower your MCAT score.  
 
Also, go grocery shopping a few days before the test so you're not stressed about finding time to do it closer to the test.  Remember that the day of the test is not the day to diet.
 
Finally, while you are writing a diagnostic test every other day in the days before the MCAT, eat the same way you will on test day.  This will help you get a sense of how much you need to eat to stay energized, and what foods work best for you.
 
Avoid eating lots of sugar, because the sugar high won't see you through the day.  Ideas for break snacks:
- a banana
- an apple
- dried apricots, figs, raisins
- almonds, or other nuts
- sunflower seeds
- chocolate or vanilla soy milk 
- some granola or trail mix
- granola bar, energy bar or cereal bar
- crackers and cheese or crackers and peanut butter
- muffin, especially one made with whole grains
- yogurt or cottage cheese (with or without granola and/or fruit)
- celery or other vegetables with hummus or other dips
 
Combining some of these might be the best option.  For example, you could have a banana and granola bar, or my personal favourite, apple with peanut butter. Get creative and eat foods that you like, and foods that give you energy.  Remember, you are what you eat, so eat brain food!
 
Cheers,
