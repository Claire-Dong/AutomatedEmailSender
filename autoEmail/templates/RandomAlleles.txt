Subject: Tip of the Day - Allele Randomness

Hey there, 

As for the tip of the day, I just wanted to remind you that alleles combine randomly in gametes due to two mechanisms:
1. independent assortment if the genes are on different chromosomes
2. recombination if the genes are on the same chromosome, but the genes are 50 m.u. apart
 
Also, remember than linkage is the exception to recombination and occurs when two genes are on the same chromosome as each other and are less than 50 map units away from each other.
 
I hope studying is going well,
Claire
