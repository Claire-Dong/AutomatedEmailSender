Subject: Amino Acid Mnemonics

Hi everyone, 

Some students have been asking me about amino acid mnemonics. Here's one way to remember things: 

- His goes both ways (ie. can be protonated or deprotonated at physiological pH)
- Polar amino acids = GCATS GA LAH (pronounced G-cats [like MCAT])
		- Polar neutral = GCATS (glutamine, cysteine, asparagine, threonine, serine)
		- Polar acidic = GA (glutamic acid, aspartic acid)
		- Polar basic = LAH (lysine, arginine, histidine)
- Non polar amino acids 
		-I find it helpful to memorize what group each polar amino acid falls into, and by default, everything else is non polar. 
		-However, there is another mnemonic for non polar amino acids!
		-"I saw Lucy methodically probe and feel Alan and then Val tripped on glycine" 
		-OR in other words "I saw (ISO) LEUcy METhodically PRObe and PHEel ALAn and then VAL TRYpped on the GLYCINE"
		-Isoleucine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine, alanine, valine, tryptophan, glycine

Cheers,
