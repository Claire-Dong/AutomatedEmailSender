Subject: Tip of the Day â€“ Hormone Classification

Hi there,
 
Just to drive the "memorize your hormones!" point home, I wanted to remind you that it's easiest if you think of peptide as default classification for the human hormones (since most hormones are peptide).  The exceptions are:
- Amines: epinephrine and thyroid hormone (TH)
- Steroids: 3 adrenal cortex hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, sex steroids), estrogen, progesterone, testosterone
 
Let me know if you have any questions,
Claire
