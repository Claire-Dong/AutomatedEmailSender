Solutions 

--------Question #1--------
 
How is red-green colour blindness inherited in humans? 
X-linked Recessive 
 
--------Question #2--------
 
2a. What two sex chromosomes do females have? 
Two X chromosomes 
 
2b. Is this considered haploid or diploid? 
Diploid because the two chromosomes are homologous. 
 
--------Question #3--------
 
3a. What two sex chromosomes do males have? 
XY
 
3b. Is this considered haploid or diploid? 
Haploid because the two chromosomes are not homologous (remember we talked about how male humans are hemizygous in class). 
 
--------Question #4--------
 
4. The frequency of the red-green colour blindness allele in the human population is 5%. What is the frequency of the wild type (or normal) allele? 
If p = frequency of the dominant allele (A) 
q = frequency of the recessive allele (a) 
Given that p + q = 1 and q = 0.05 
Therefore p = 0.95 
 
--------Question #5--------
 
5a. What percentage of females will be colourblind? 
This will equal the q2 term of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium equation 
q2 = (0.05)2 = 0.0025 = 0.25% (notice that this is 1 out of 400 females – not very many) 
 
5b. What percentage of females will carry the colour blind allele but not be colourblind? 
This will equal the 2pq term of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium equation 
2pq = 2(0.95)(0.05) = 0.095 = 9.5% 
 
5c. What is the generic term used to describe these females? 
Carriers, because they carry the recessive allele but do not phenotypically express it 
 
 
5d. What percentage of females will carry two wild type alleles? 
This will equal the p2 term of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium equation 
p2 = (0.95)2 = 0.9025 = 90.25% 
 
5e. What percentage of females will have normal vision? 
There are two ways to answer this question 
First:
You could have noticed that this will equal the p2 + 2qp term of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium equation 
p2 + 2pq = 0.9025 + 0.095 = 0.9975 = 99.75% 
Second:
You could have thought that this would include XAXA OR XAXa females 
Since this is an “OR” statement, you could add your answers from questions 5b and 5d: 0.095 + 0.9025 = 0.9975 = 99.75% 
 
5f. What percentage of females will have normal vision or be colour blind? 
There are three ways to answer this question 
First:
You might have recognized that this would include the p2 + 2pq + q2 terms (all the terms) from the Hardy-Weinberg equation 
Therefore, p2 + 2pq + q2 = 0.9025 + 0.095 + 0.0025 = 1 
This is a great way to check that your math adds up to 1 (or 100%) 
Second:
You could add your answers from question 5a and 5e (since this questions asks “OR”, remember to add, not multiply) 
Therefore, 0.0025 + 0.9975 = 1 (or 100%) 
Third:
You might have seen that this must include the whole population of females 
The answer must therefore be 100% 
 
5g. What is the name of the equation you used to answer question 5? 
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium 
 
--------Question #6--------
 
6a. What percentage of males will be colourblind? 
Since males are haploid for this trait, the phenotypic ratio is equal to the allele frequency 
Since q = 0.05 (the frequency of the Xa allele in the population), 5% of males will be colourblind (and get the Xa chromosome from their mom) 
Remember that their dad must give them a Y chromosome 
 
6b. What percentage of males will be wild type? 
Again, since males are haploid for this trait, the phenotypic ratio is equal to the allele frequency 
Since p = 0.95 (the frequency of the XA allele in the population), 95% of males will have normal vision (and get the XA chromosome from their mom) 
Remember that their dad must give them a Y chromosome 
 

6c. What percentage of males will be colourblind or have normal vision? 
Similar to question 5f, there are three ways to answer this question 
First:
You might have recognized that this would include the p + q terms from the Hardy-Weinberg equation 
Therefore, p + q = 0.95 + 0.05 = 1 
This is a great way to check that your math adds up to 1 (or 100%) 
Second:
You could add your answers from question 6a and 6b (since this questions asks “OR”, remember to add, not multiply) 
Therefore, 0.95 + 0.05 = 1 (or 100%) 
Third:
You might have seen that this must include the whole population of males 
The answer must therefore be 100% 
 
--------Question #7--------
 
7a. Are there more colourblind males or colourblind females in the population? 
We found in question 5a that 0.25% of females are colourblind 
We found in question 6a that 5% of males are colourblind 
Therefore, there are more colourblind males in the population 
 
7b. Why? 
In order for females to be colourblind, they need to get both copies of the rare Xa allele 
Since this allele is relatively rare (only 5% allele frequency), the probability of getting both recessive alleles is very low
