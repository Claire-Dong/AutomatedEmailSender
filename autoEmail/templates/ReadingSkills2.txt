Subject: Tip of the Day – Reading Skills Part 2

Hi there,

In all sections of the MCAT (sciences and CARS), solid reading skills are vital for success, and now is the time to start working on this! The key to seeing improvements in your reading skills is to start working on them now, and to continue to work on them everyday.

Your single best strategy for MCAT preparation is practice with actual passages. However, there is great benefit to be gained by sustained reading in the kinds of publications that the MCAT draws from. Reading entire articles or books (and reading for long periods of time) will help you with reading skills and stamina. You should especially consider reading in disciplines that (through practice with passages) you have identified as difficult for you.

Practice the same reading skills you are learning in class in all of your outside reading, and treat the source like an MCAT passage:
• Read quickly or skim read
• Highlight for logical structure and key words
• Summarize the main point of each paragraph on scratch paper
• Define the "Bottom Line" of each section: what is the author trying to convince you of, why are they doing this, and how?

Remember: You are reading not to learn the content of the text, but to hone your MCAT reading skills.

The newspaper is a good place to start for now, but be sure to read ALL the articles, not just the ones that interest you.

Best,
Claire
