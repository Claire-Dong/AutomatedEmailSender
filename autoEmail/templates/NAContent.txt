Subject: N/A Biology Content

Hey everyone, 

I wanted to send you a quick email to review what biology is on the MCAT and what biology is not.  MCAT biology includes cell, molecular, microbiology and genetics (these are covered in the first 6 classes) and human physiology (which is taught in the last 5 classes).
 
The following topics are not tested on the MCAT:
- plant biology of any sort
- ecology
- behaviour and learning
- animal physiology
- anything that is not in your MCAT Biochemistry and Biology Review books
 
There is the possibility of some evolution content being on the test (this is covered in the pre-readings for Bio class 6 but won't be covered at great depth in class).
 
So the bottom line is that if the information is in your text book, it is fair game on the MCAT.  If it is not there, you do not need to know it.  Your Review book also emphasizes what material is important (and this will also be done in class A LOT) and what material can be considered secondary.
 
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks,
Claire
