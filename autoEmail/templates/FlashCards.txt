Subject: Tip of the Day – Flash Cards

Hello!

I've been teaching and tutoring for a long time, and I've seen students use flash cards (or cue cards) in the weirdest ways imaginable.  I wanted to give you some feedback on some of the best and more efficient ways to use flash cards to help you study for the MCAT.

-------------Physics and Gchem Equations-------------
On the front of the flash card:
- the equation

On the back of the flash card:
- what the variables stand for and their typical units
- the name of the equation (eg Coulomb's law)
- when you use the equation



-------------Ochem Reactions-------------
On the front:
- reactants and reaction conditions (including catalyst, temperature, etc.)

On the back:
- products
- reaction name (eg transesterification)



-------------Biology – Amino Acids-------------
On the front:
- amino acid name

On the back:
- 1 letter abbreviation
- 3 letter abbreviation
- group (polar, nonpolar, acidic, basic)



-------------Biology - Human Hormones-------------
On the front:
- hormone name

On the back:
- where it comes from
- where it goes
- what it does
- classification (peptide vs steroid vs amine)



--------------------------Definitions--------------------------
- use these flash cards to help you remember key definitions that you always forget
- do not put every definition in the book on flash cards - HUGE waste of time
- target only the ones you struggle with and really need to get memorized

On the front:
- term

On the back:
- definition
- where it is used (ie what lecture/topic/chapter is the term from?)



--------------------------Colour Scheme--------------------------
- it is possible to buy coloured flash cards (like the ones I used for your name tags)
- I liked using one colour per subject (physics, gchem, ochem, biology)



--------------------------Get them Made and USE THEM--------------------------
- the point behind flash cards is not to make them but to USE them
- get them made as quickly as possible and use them as much as possible
- quiz yourself forwards and backwards (ie look at the front and predict the back, or look at the back and predict the front)
- use them with a classmate or friend (or make your partner quiz you)
- be CRITICAL about what goes on a flash card so you don't end up with a useless stack of 800 cards
- only really key things you need to memorize should be on there

Good luck studying and let me know if you have any questions,
